- [x] No development tools in production build
- [x] Source maps disabled in production

### Headers
- [x] CORS properly configured
- [x] Content-Type headers set correctly

## Data Privacy

### User Data
- [x] Minimal data collection

### Admin Data
- [x] Admin emails stored securely
- [x] No password storage in custom tables
- [x] Authentication delegated to Supabase
- [x] Last login tracking for audit

## Testing Checklist

### Authentication Tests
- [ ] Test login with valid credentials
- [ ] Test login with invalid credentials
- [ ] Test protected routes without auth
- [ ] Test session persistence
- [ ] Test sign-out functionality

### Authorization Tests
- [ ] Test public access to public data
- [ ] Test public insert to event submissions
- [ ] Test admin CRUD operations
- [ ] Test non-admin access to admin operations
- [ ] Test RLS policies with different users

### Input Validation Tests
- [ ] Test form submissions with invalid data
- [ ] Test SQL injection attempts
- [ ] Test XSS attempts
- [ ] Test file upload validation
- [ ] Test URL validation

### Edge Function Tests
- [ ] Test WhatsApp webhook with valid data
- [ ] Test webhook with invalid data
- [ ] Test CORS preflight requests
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Test authentication requirements

## Incident Response

### Monitoring
- Supabase dashboard for database monitoring
- Error tracking in Supabase logs
- Authentication logs in Supabase Auth

### Backup
- Automatic daily backups by Supabase
- Point-in-time recovery available
- Migration files versioned in repository

### Updates
- Regular dependency updates
- Security patches applied promptly
- Supabase platform updates automatic

## Compliance

- [x] No sensitive data logged to console
- [x] No PII exposed in URLs
- [x] Secure communication (HTTPS)
- [x] Data retention policies can be implemented
- [x] User can request data deletion

## Notes

1. **Admin User Creation**: Admin users must be created manually via Supabase dashboard + SQL insert. This prevents unauthorized admin registration.

2. **RLS Verification**: All RLS policies verify admin status by checking the `admin_users` table, not by role claims in JWT.

3. **WhatsApp Integration**: The WhatsApp webhook formats and returns a URL; actual sending is handled client-side via WhatsApp deep links.

4. **Database Access**: The anon key is used for all client operations. RLS policies enforce access control.

5. **No Service Role Key**: The service role key (if obtained) should NEVER be used in frontend code or committed to repository.
