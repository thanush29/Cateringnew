## Migration Path

To apply these changes to an existing installation:

1. **Backup existing data** (if any)
2. **Run new migration**: Execute `100_fresh_schema_rebuild.sql`
3. **Create admin user** in Supabase Auth
4. **Link admin user** to `admin_users` table
5. **Verify RLS policies** are working correctly
6. **Test all CRUD operations** in admin dashboard
7. **Test WhatsApp webhook** with event submission

## Breaking Changes

### Database
- All old tables are dropped and recreated
- No migration path for existing blog/menu data
- New schema structure for testimonials and gallery
- Contact inquiries replaced with event submissions

### Frontend
- Blog routes removed (`/blog`, `/blog/:slug`)
- Menu section removed from homepage
- Old admin tabs removed (blog, menu, logo, inquiries)
- New admin tabs added (gallery, testimonials, content, submissions)

### API
- Blog-related queries will fail
- Menu-related queries will fail
- Contact inquiry inserts should use event submissions table
- New fields required for testimonials and gallery

## Verification Steps

After deployment, verify:

1. ✓ Admin login works
2. ✓ Gallery CRUD operations work
3. ✓ Testimonial CRUD operations work
4. ✓ Site content CRUD operations work
5. ✓ Event submissions can be viewed and managed
6. ✓ Public pages load correctly
7. ✓ No console errors
8. ✓ RLS policies enforce correct access
9. ✓ WhatsApp integration works
10. ✓ Mobile responsiveness maintained

## Known Issues

None at this time. All core functionality has been tested and verified.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. Image upload directly to Supabase Storage
2. Email notifications for event submissions
3. Calendar integration for event dates
4. Analytics dashboard for admin
5. Multi-language support
6. Advanced filtering and search
